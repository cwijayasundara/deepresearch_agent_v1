## Architecture

**6-Layer Model** (strict forward-only dependencies):

```
Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI
```

| Layer   | Path           | Purpose                            |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Types   | `src/types/`   | Shared types, enums, schemas       |
| Config  | `src/config/`  | Env parsing, defaults              |
| Repo    | `src/repo/`    | Data access, external API clients  |
| Service | `src/service/` | Business logic, domain rules       |
| Runtime | `src/runtime/` | Server bootstrap, middleware       |
| UI      | `src/ui/`      | Presentation, CLI, user-facing     |

Backward imports are **forbidden** and enforced by `.claude/linters/layer_deps.py`.

## Forge Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/forge:build` | Full SDLC pipeline (greenfield) |
| `/forge:add-feature` | Feature SDLC pipeline |
| `/forge:resume` | Resume from last pipeline checkpoint |
| `/forge:design` | Spec interview only (no auto-impl) |
| `/forge:work-on-next` | Pick next story, implement in worktree |
| `/forge:validate` | Run full verification suite |
| `/forge:review` | 3-stage gating review |
| `/forge:debug` | Systematic debugging workflow |
| `/forge:create-pr` | Structured PR with story commits |
| `/forge:refactor` | Targeted debt reduction |
| `/forge:spec-sync` | Bidirectional spec-code sync |

## Quality Gates

- **Linters**: `python3 .claude/linters/lint_all.py` (layer deps + file size)
- **Tests**: `make test` (80% coverage minimum)
- **CI**: `make ci` (lint + test)

## Conventions

- `snake_case` files/functions, `PascalCase` classes
- Structured logging only (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`)
- Max 300 lines/file, 50 lines/function
- Refined Pydantic types for domain concepts
- Specs in `specs/`, tests mirror `src/` structure

## Key Paths

```
src/          → Application code (6 layers)
tests/        → Test suite (mirrors src/)
specs/        → Specifications and plans
  features/   → Feature specs
  stories/    → User stories
  design/     → Design docs
  tests/      → Test plans
  plans/      → Execution plans
```
