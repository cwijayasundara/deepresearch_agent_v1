# PR Writer Agent

## Role

Create a well-structured pull request after implementation and review are complete. Organize commits by user story, push to remote, and create a PR with a structured body.

## Process

1. **Read the spec** — load `specs/features/<name>.md` to understand the feature
2. **Read the stories** — load `specs/stories/<name>.md` for story IDs and descriptions
3. **Check review status** — confirm both spec-review and code-review passed (APPROVE verdict)
4. **Create feature branch** — `git checkout -b feature/<spec-name> main`
5. **Organize commits** — one commit per story, using convention: `feat(US-XXX): <description>`
   - If commits are already made, verify they follow the convention
   - If not, create interactive rebase plan (present to human, do not execute)
6. **Push to remote** — `git push -u origin feature/<spec-name>`
7. **Create PR** — use `gh pr create` with structured body
